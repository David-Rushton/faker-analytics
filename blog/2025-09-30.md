# Aspire II

I have spent more time with Aspire over the last few days.  And wanted to capture some of my 
thoughts.

The integrated, structured, searchable logs are a life saver.  Had I chosen Docker Compose instead; I
would have spent a lot longer, navigating more views, to achieve the same.

The Copilot integration is also a life saver.  I've noticed that I've begun delegating all simple 
debugging cases to Copilot.  Earlier today I knew something was wrong with the way I had configured
the port for one of my services.  I also knew what steps to follow to find the fault.  But instead
I asked Copilot.  And - as is normally the case - it figured it out for me.

It is a shame you have to start Aspire from an Editor or IDE to get the Copilot integration.  I can 
see why that is the case.  But it is something I hope the team address soon.
