# Hola Mundo

As the [README] states I've created this project to develop a better understanding of the capabilities
of generative AI.  I wanted to better understanding how generative AI can extend exiting
"traditional applications".  I am particularly interested in:

- How can we integrate AI into existing apps?
- How do we manage the boundary between AI and imperative code?
- How do we manage failure cases?
- How do we assert quality - or the lack of?
- How does control of flow differ, when we introduce probabilistic gen AI calls into the mix?
- How does the state management differ - if at all?

> WARNING!

I'm writing this blog to help me organise my thoughts.  It is entirely possible - likely? - that 
it will only be of interest to me.
