# Aspire

Having committed to the complication of a discovery service ([last time on faker analytics!]) I've
chosen to add [Aspire] to my stack.  I'm using it as local orchestration tool.  To manage my 
services and secrets etc.

Aspire also provides a dashboard.  Which contains an overview of all my services.  From here I can 
view the (structured) logs, metrics and traces.  But what really sold me is the Copilot support.

Given this repo is a gen AI experiment how could I refuse the chance to debug my apps using natural 
language?

Mostly things just work.  However I noticed some of the Aspire OTEL services didn't trust the .Net 
dev cert.  I've dropped down to standard http for now (`ASPIRE_ALLOW_UNSECURED_TRANSPORT=true`).  Given 
that HTTPS is the default, and local environments are the main use case; I would expect it to just work.
But hay ho.  At least it is documented in the [troubleshooting docs](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/troubleshooting/allow-unsecure-transport?tabs=windows).

Otherwise I found the integration painless.
